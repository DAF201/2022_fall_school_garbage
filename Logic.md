## Propositions

proposition is a claim that can only be true or false

## propositional variables

propositional variables is a symbol that denote a case. For example, p denotes ground is wet.

Each propositional variable has a truth value T or F

Proposition can be <b>Atomic</b> or <b>Compound</b>

Atomic: Cannot be splited down

Compound: Can be splited down

## Logical Operators

Belows are Connectives:

Negation ¬

Conjunction ∧

Disjunction ∨

XOR ⊕

Implication →

Biconditional ⇔

## Truth table

A truth table is a enum of all posiable cases and results

Example:

| p   | q   | p ∧ q |
| --- | --- | ----- |
| T   | T   | T     |
| T   | F   | F     |
| F   | T   | F     |
| F   | F   | F     |

This table shows all the posiable cases and result of the proposition p∧q

## Negation

Means opposite: 

p = T, then ¬p = F

## AND

Only be true when both are true, otherwise false.

p = T, q = T, p ∧ q = T

p = T, q = F, p ∧ q = F

## OR

Only be false when both are false, otherwise true.

p = F, q = F, p ∨ q = F

p = T, q = F, p ∨ q = T

## XOR

Return the result of "p and q have different truth value". Negation of Biconditional(⇔)

p = T, q = F, p ⊕ q = T

p = T, q = T, p ⊕ q = F

## Biconditional

Return the result of "p and q have same truth value". Negation of XOR(⊕). Also known as iff (if and only if)

p = F, q = F, p ⇔ q = T

p = T, q = F, p ⇔ q = F

## Implication

Only return false when case 1 is true, case 2 is false. Also known as <b>if ...  then ...</b>

p = T, q = T, p → q = T

p = T, q = F, p → q = F

p = F, q = T, p → q = T

p = F, q = F, p → q = T

> ### Vacuous Truth
> when the case 1 is false, no matter what is the truth value of case 2, the output is true, because we cannot make any conclusion when case 1 is false, so we assume the claim is true.

## Converse, Contrapositive, and Inverse

From p → q we can form new conditional statements .

q → p is the converse of p → q

¬p → ¬q is the inverse of p → q

¬q → ¬p is the contrapositive of p → q

## Precedence of Logical Operators

| Operator | Precedence |
| -------- | ---------- |
| ¬        | 1          |
| ∧        | 2          |
| ∨        | 3          |
| →        | 4          |
| ⇔        | 5          |

## translate to english

Unless means if ... not ...
>–Unless I work hard, I will fail the exam
>
>If I do not work hard then I will fail the exam

## Tautologies, Contradictions, and Contingencies

Tautologies: something always true, example p ∨ ¬p

Contradictions: something always false, example p ∧ ¬p

Contingency: something neither Tautologies or Contradictions, example p ⇔ q

## Logical Equivalences
